I like how you included the information about each skate park near us and showed what they look like with details.

I like how you explained how people dont always look at the good things that skaters do and mostly the bad. 
I also never noticed how the skate parks were bad or not really any near us.

Do you think people wouldn't distrust skaters so much if skateparks were kept in better condition, since people 
tend to associate the traits of an area with the people who inhabit it?
